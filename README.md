# Buildscript
This is the build script which includes how to sync &amp; how to configure &amp; how to build ROM... Change it as per your rom you just need a bit of editing if you want... !! 

It will be a good gesture if you don't kang it ... !! Just Fork it ... |'`-_-`'|

Configure it as per your ROM
Well basic description of what my scripts can be used for :-

clone_build.sh ---> Used for cloning and building ROM. </br>
env.sh --->  Used for setting up Build environment. </br>
Kernel.sh ---> Used for cloning &amp; compiling kernel for Tissot. </br>
mybuildcript.sh ---> My personal script. </br>
os_setup.sh ---> Used for installing and configuring some basic stuff when you install fresh os. </br>

Give it the permission it needs by `chown` or `chmod`
Some scripts even need to be run as `Super User`.

# All the scripts are very helpful
