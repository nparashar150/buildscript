## Buildscript
This is the build script which includes how to sync &amp; how to configure &amp; how to build ROM... Change it as per your rom you just need a bit of editing if you want... !!

It will be a good gesture if you don't kang it ... !! Just Fork it ... |'`:D`'|

Configure it as per your ROM
Well basic description of what my scripts can be used for :-

-  <b>all.sh</b> ---> Better Script for basic work, run it and you won't need to run other scripts I hope xD. </br>
-  <b>clone_build.sh</b> ---> Used for cloning and building ROM. </br>
-  <b>env.sh</b> --->  Used for setting up Build environment. </br>
-  <b>kernel.sh</b> ---> Used for cloning &amp; compiling kernel for Tissot. </br>
-  <b>mybuildcript.sh</b> ---> My personal script. </br>
-  <b>os_setup.sh</b> ---> Used for installing and configuring some basic stuff when you install fresh os. </br>
-  <b>upload.sh</b> ---> Used to upload the files from server or local to Mega </br>

Give it the permission it needs by <b>`chown`</b> or <b>`chmod`</b>
Some scripts even need to be run as <b>`root`</b>.

## All the scripts are very helpful
