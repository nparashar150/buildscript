## Buildscript
This is the build script which includes how to sync &amp; how to configure &amp; how to build ROM... Change it as per your rom you just need a bit of editing if you want... !! 

It will be a good gesture if you don't kang it ... !! Just Fork it ... |'`<#!/>`'|

Configure it as per your ROM
Well basic description of what my scripts can be used for :-

1) all.sh ---> Better Script for basic work, run it and you won't need to run other scripts I hope xD. </br>
2) clone_build.sh ---> Used for cloning and building ROM. </br>
3) env.sh --->  Used for setting up Build environment. </br>
4) kernel.sh ---> Used for cloning &amp; compiling kernel for Tissot. </br>
5) mybuildcript.sh ---> My personal script. </br>
6) os_setup.sh ---> Used for installing and configuring some basic stuff when you install fresh os. </br>
7) upload.sh ---> Used to upload the files from server or local to Mega </br>

Give it the permission it needs by `chown` or `chmod`
Some scripts even need to be run as `Super User`.

## All the scripts are very helpful
