# noob_buildscript
This is the build script which includes how to sync &amp; how to configure &amp; how to build ROM... Change it as per your rom you just need a bit of tweaking... !! 

It will be a good gesture if you don't kang it ... !! Just Fork it ... |'`-_-`'|

Configure it as per your ROM
Remove ZRam and Metalava lines if you have more than 8Gb of ram 
As I have 8Gb so I need these patches 

Give it the permission it needs by `chowm` or `chmod`
# Both the scripts are very helpful
